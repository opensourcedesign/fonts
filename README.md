Free Open Source Fonts
=========================================

This started as my collection of free fonts that I continually use in my work, and I wanted to be able to easily sync them between my computers. I thought it might be useful to others, so here they are.

Clone into your ~/.local/share/fonts or ~/Library/Fonts directory

I have tried to be very thorough with checking each license before including it here, but I might have missed something, if I'm accidentally infringing on any copyrights, just drop me a message and I will remove non-free fonts immediately
